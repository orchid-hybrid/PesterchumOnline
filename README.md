Pesterchum Online
================
This is the repository for Pesterchum Online, a browser-based client for the Pesterchum IRC network. It runs off NodeJS, using the NodeIRC library. Express and EJS are used for serving pages.

##Getting started  
PCO uses NodeJS - if you haven't installed that yet, [do so](http://nodejs.org/download/).  
Run `npm install` in the root directory to get all the required modules down, then run `node PCO.js` to start the app. If everything went in right, you should see something like this:

```
PCO v0.1.0 started.
  Configured HTML engine using EJS.
  Using HTML as view engine.
  Loaded bodyParser.
  Serving views on /views.
  Serving resources on /public.
  Listening on port 612.
```

The app uses `process.env.PORT` if it exists (if you're using Heroku or Cloud9, for example) - if not, it defaults to `:612`. Open a browser to the logged port to see where everything starts.

##Technical overview  
###Basic functionality:  
The user starts on the index page and inputs a handle. This is checked against Pesterchum specifications using the RegEx `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*[A-Z][a-z0-9]*$/` (the handle must start with a lowercase letter, have exactly one uppercase letter, and contain only alphanumeric characters). Modernizr checks sessionStorage availability - if it's available, it's used to pass the handle to the next page. If not, `window.name` is used.

The client goes to the main page and gets the nick from either sessionStorage or `window.name`. It checks it again with the same RegEx, then transmits it to the server in an HTTP `POST` to /znewclient. If the RegEx fails validation, the client is bounced back to the index page. Otherwise, the server receives the request and does the following:

* Increments the `clientstotal` counter
* Pushes an object to the `clients` array containing the client's connection details
* Sets an interval corresponding to the new client's ID that increments the client's `missedpings` every 0.75 seconds
    * If five pings have been missed, the client is killed and the interval is cleared
* Creates an array for the client in the `clientlogs` array
* Initiates an IRC connection to `irc.mindfang.org` using the client's object in the `clients` array
* Adds a `message` listener to the connection
    * Adds a space at the end of the message if one doesn't exist already (this solves issues with IRC and Chumdroid)
    * Replaces color tags and special characters using `htmlFormatFct`
    * Checks if the channel the message was sent from is `#pesterchum` or if the message is a `PESTERCHUM:TIME` message
        * If not, formatted message is pushed to the `clientlogs` array corresponding to the client
        * If so, **[WIP]**
* Sends the client its object from the `clients` array

The client sets its global `client` variable to the received object and moves on. It then sets an interval to run `ircUpdateFct` every 0.75 seconds to match the server's ping frequency. That function does the following:

* Transmits the client's ID to the server in an HTTP `POST` to /zupdate
    * The server resets the client's `missedpings` to 0 and sends back its `clientlogs` array
* If the `POST` fails (i.e. the server is offline/not responding), the client kills itself and reloads the page
* If the `POST` is successful, it receives its message log and displays it by joining the array items with a `<br>`
* The message display div is scrolled to the bottom using `scrollTop` and `scrollHeight`

The client then prepares all UI content and event handlers.

###Active functionality:  
**Joining a memo:**  
The client checks to see if the memo already exists in its `channels` array (i.e. if it is already in the memo). If not, it transmits its ID and the requested memo to the server in an HTTP `POST` to /zjoinememo. The server uses the client's ID to have the corresponding IRC connection send a channel join request.

**Sending a message:**  
The client transmits its ID, the message, and the memo to which to send the message to the server in an HTTP `POST` to /zsendmessage. The server receives this and doe the following:

* Uses `handle[0].toUpperCase()+/[A-Z]/.exec(handle)[0]` to get the client's two-letter prefix
* Adds the prefix to the message along with its color
* Uses the client's ID to have the corresponding IRC connection send the message to the memo
* Replaces color tags and special characters using `htmlFormatFct`
* Pushes the formatted message to the `clientlogs` array corresponding to the client
